                    Welcome to the High Noon Gamble of Alcoholics Anonymous, my name is ***** and I am an alcoholic.
                    <br></br><br></br> 
                    I would like to open up the meeting with a moment of silence for those who are still suffering in and out of the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous.<br></br><br></br>
                    If you choose, please join me in the we version of the Serenity Prayer:<br></br><br></br>
                    God, grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, courage to change the things we can, and wisdom to know the difference.<br></br><br></br>
                    <strong>AA Preamble</strong><br></br><br></br>
                    Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of people who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.<br></br><br></br> 
                    The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for A.A. membership; we are self- supporting through our own contributions.<br></br><br></br>A.A. is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.<br></br><br></br> 
                    I have asked ***** to read a portion of the Big Book:<br></br>
                    How it Works pg. 58<br></br>
                    There is a Solution pg. 17
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    <strong>Zoom Etiquette</strong><br></br><br></br>
                    We ask that everyone stay on MUTE for the duration of the meeting so that we may hear the speaker more clearly.<br></br><br></br>The mute button is in the left corner of the bottom of your screen. When you would like to share, please unmute, and introduce yourself. If someone else is sharing and you would like to go next, the raise hand feature is located in your participant’s window. To the right of your microphone is a camera to share or stop video.<br></br><br></br>If you have your camera on, please stay in appropriate attire and activity aka no drinking, drug use or nudity in the meeting.<br></br><br></br>Chat will stay locked to the hosts only for the duration of the meeting. At the end I will turn it back on so that you can plug meetings or AA/Non-AA announcements and exchange information.<br></br><br></br>For meeting attendance requests, message me your full name and email, I will complete those after the meeting.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    This, and all ZOOMintoAA homegroup meetings observe the AA safety card adapted for online meetings.  
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    <strong>AA SAFETY CARD ADAPTED FOR ONLINE (SHORT VERSION)</strong>
                    <br></br><br></br>We ask that group members and others refrain from any behavior which may compromise another person’s safety or ability to participate in the meeting, such as taking pictures of participants, exposing details from meetings or shares in outside venues including but not limited to all physical or digital media open to public view that could put personal or group anonymity in jeopardy, and harassing members in chat or in crosstalk. Also, please take precautions you feel are necessary to ensure your own personal safety, for example, asking the host to edit your name in a meeting if your full name is on your profile, and not disclosing personal information such as phone number or address in the public chat or your share.
